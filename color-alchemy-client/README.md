# color-alchemy-client React App

This RGB Alchemy application is built by React & TypeScript and contains one screen and some components for the simple RGB Alchemy game interface.

It is a small game application in which the player can try to mix colors to create new colors. The game goal is to get a color which “matches” the target color in limited moves.
